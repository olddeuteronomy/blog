My first attempt to dive into the ocean of Emacs was in 1998, almost
20 years ago. It was an unsuccessful attempt; it seems to me now, I
wasn't able to realize *the spirit* of Emacs.

A second attempt was in 2011, 6 years ago. Since then, I use Emacs for
almost everything, from C++ or Python coding to twittering and writing
articles in LaTeX.

Expect some typos and spelling errors. Please be patient, English is
not my mother language.
